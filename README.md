# attractor-generator

A web application that allows you to generate and visualise attractors in 3D for dynamical systems.

You can find a live demo [here](https://antonyloose.github.io/attractor-generator/).

## Running the Application

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:AntonyLoose/attractor-generator.git
```

Install `http-server`:

```bash
npm -g i http-server
```

This will install `http-server` globally, if you do not plan on using this in the future, I would recommend
uninstalling once you are done with this project:

```bash
npm -g uninstall http-server
```

Run the server:

```bash
http-server /path/to/attractor-generator/src
```

Now open [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
